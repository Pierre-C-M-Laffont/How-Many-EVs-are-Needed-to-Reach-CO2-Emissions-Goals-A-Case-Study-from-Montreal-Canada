All versions of the modified database from Natural Resources Canada are in this
folder. They have to be sorted using the "tri_emiss.py" script to make the
scripts work faster.





groupementSAAQ.py :
	Scripts to analyse CO2 emissions in the database.


mm_veh_... :
	Vehicles with a recording in more than only one database (conventional,
	hybride or electric vehicles)


tests_emiss.py :
	Tests on the vehicles. Includes the scripts used to create the
	"mm_veh..." series.


transfo.py :
	Big script used to modify the database and match it to that of the SAAQ.


tri_emiss.py :
	Sorting functions to be applied to the databases.
