	in 2018.


veh_par_SM_2030.csv :
	Same as above, but for 2030.





Important features of the result files (obtained with the script nÂ°0) ("resus"
folder) :


l7, "emissions totales : " -> Hypothetical current emissions with the fleet and
emission values used.

l9, "on part de A et on veut B (diminution de C%)" -> we start with A MtonnesCO2,
we want to reach B Mtonnes. C is the rate of decrease.


last line, "D veh changes contre E au depart, F % de vehicules changes" -> D
vehicles were replaced with electric ones. E is the total number of vehicles. F
